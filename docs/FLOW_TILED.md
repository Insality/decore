# Flow Tiled

## Setup

Open Tilen
New Project
Create /tiled folder (can use other folder name)
Name project with the project name to easier find it inside Tiled (it uses filename as a project name)

### Create First Map

Create new map, any settings
Save at /tiled/maps folder
Select Export as JSON (/resources/maps/level_name.json)

### Create first tileset

New Tileset (collection of images)
Press Plus -> Select image to add first entity
Seems better to create the folder with all images inside tiled.
Select Export as JSON (/resources/tilesets/tileset_name.json)
